# Binary-Cards
Binary Cards Is a python program to generate playing cards whose faces have numbers.
You can print out the cards, then ask them to think of a number between 1 and 49 . Then show them the cards.

Collect all cards in which they say their chosen number is present. Add all powers of two ( Top left corner numbers are powers of two) to arrive at their number. 

The presence of absence of a number in a card is determined if that power of two has a 0 or a 1 digit in the number's binary representation.

The 6 images in the git repo are generated for maximum number 49. You can re run the program by changing that variable to generate a different set of cards.

A pdf has been added which you can print on a a4 sized sheet of paper, cut and then use.
